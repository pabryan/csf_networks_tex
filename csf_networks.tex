\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}
\section{Notation and Definitions}
\label{sec:orgheadline5}

\subsection{Networks}
\label{sec:orgheadline2}

We consider networks with a single loop, \(\network = (\gamma, L)\) with \(L = \{L_i\}_{i=0}^{k-1}\). For us this means we have a piecewise smooth embedding for the loop:
\[
\gamma : \sphere^1 \to \RR^2.
\]
Let \(\{a_i\}_{i=0}^{k-1} \subset \sphere^1\) be such that \(\gamma\) is smooth on \(\sphere^1 \setdiff \{a_i\}\). We call \(\{a_i\}\) the nodes. We also have free ends \(L_i : [0, 1) \to \RR^2\) which are pairwise disjoint, smooth embeddings satisfying \(L_i(0) = \gamma(a_i)\), each curve \(L_i(0, 1)\) is disjoint from \(\gamma(\sphere^1)\), and either,
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\lim_{x\to 1} |L_i(x)| = \infty\), or
\item \(\lim_{x\to 1} L_i(x) \in \bdry{\Omega}\) where \(\Omega \subset \RR^2\) is a compact, convex set with non-empty interior properly containing the loop, \(\gamma(\sphere^1) \subset \interior{\Omega}\).
\end{enumerate}
In either case, \(L_i(0,1)\) is contained in the region exterior to \(\gamma(\sphere^1)\).

Fixing an orientation on \(\sphere^1\) and parametrising the loop \(\gamma\) over \([0, 2\pi]\) we assume that,
\[
0 = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_{k-1} < a_k = 2\pi
\]
and we always consider \(i\) modulo \(k\). Let us also write \(I_i = [a_{i-1}, a_i]\) and \(\gamma_i = \gamma|_{I_i}\) for the smooth connected arcs, which by assumption are smooth up to the boundary and satisfy \(\gamma_i(a_i) = \gamma_{i+1}(a_i)\) (\(i\) modulo \(k\)).

We also impose the \emph{triple condition} at the nodes: let
\[
\tang^{\pm} (a_i) = \lim_{x\to a_i^{\pm}} \frac{\gamma'(x)}{\|\gamma'(x)\|}, \quad \tang_{L_i}(0) = \frac{L_i'(0)}{\|L_i'(0)\|}
\]
denote respectively the tangents to the loop on either side of the node \(a_i\) and the tangent to the free curve \(L_i\) at \(a_i\). Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:triplecondition}
\ip{\tang^+(a_i)}{-\tang^-(a_i)} = \ip{\tang^{\pm}(a_i)}{\tang_{L_i}(0)} = - \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
In other words, the tangents make equal angles \(2\pi/3\) at the nodes. See figure \ref{fg:network}.

Let us write \(\tang\) for the oriented, unit tangent and \(\nor\) for the unit, outer normal to \(\gamma\) on the smooth part \(\gamma^{\ast} = \gamma(\sphere^1\setdiff\{a_i\})\). Let us also write \(\tang_i\), \(\nor_i\) for the oriented unit, tangent and outer normal respectively to the connected smooth arcs \(\gamma_i\). At a node, write
\[
\nor_i^{\pm}(a_i) = \lim_{x\to a_i^{\pm}} \nor
\]
for the normals either side of the node \(a_i\). From the triple condition \eqref{eq:triplecondition} and the fact that each \(L_i\) is outward pointing, we have the relations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:triplerelations}
\ip{-\tang^+}{\nor^-} = \ip{\tang^-}{\nor^+} = \ip{\nor_i^{\pm}}{\tang_i} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\end{equation}
Analogously we also write \(\curvecurv\) for the curvature of \(\gamma^{\ast}\), \(\curvecurv_i\) for the curvature of the connected arcs \(\gamma_i\) and \(\curvecurv^{\pm}_i\) for the curvature of the loop on either side of the node \(a_i\). If needed, we will write \(\curvecurv_{L_i}\) for the curvature of the free curves \(L_i\). Our convention for the Frenet-Serret equations is that the curvature vector of a convex curve is inward pointing so that,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:frenetserret}
\partial_s \tang = -\curvecurv \nor, \quad \partial_s \nor = \curvecurv \tang
\end{equation}
with \(s\) denoting the arc-length parameter.

\subsection{Curve Shortening of Networks}
\label{sec:orgheadline3}

\begin{defn}
A smooth, one-parameter family \(\network_t = (\gamma_t, L_t)\), \(\gamma_t = (\gamma_i)_t\), \(L_t = (L_i)_t\), \(i=1,\cdots,k\) of embedded networks with one loop satisfying the triple condition \eqref{eq:triplecondition} evolves by \emph{curve shortening} if for each \(i\),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:csf}
\left(\pd[\gamma_i]{t}\right)^{\perp} = -\curvecurv, \quad \text{and} \quad \left(\pd[L_i]{t}\right)^{\perp} = -\curvecurv.
\end{equation}
Here, for a vector field \(X\) along a curve, \(X^{\perp} = \ip{X}{\nor}\) denotes the outer normal component of \(X\) on the smooth part \(\network^{\ast} = (\gamma^{\ast}, L)\).
\end{defn}

In general, in order that for each \(t\), \(\network_t\) is an embedded network with one loop satisfying the triple condition \eqref{eq:triplecondition}, and evolving by the curve shortening flow \eqref{eq:csf}, there must be a non-zero tangential component of the speed. In other words,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:csf_with_tang}
\pd[\gamma_i]{t} = -\curvecurv_i \nor_i + \tangspeed_i \tang_i, \quad \pd[L_i]{t} = -\curvecurv_{L_i} \nor_{L_i} + \tangspeed_{L_i} \tang_{L_i}
\end{equation}
where \(\tangspeed_i, \tangspeed_{L_i}\) are any smooth functions satisfying
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:speedcompatability}
-\curvecurv_i^+ \nor_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \tang_i^+ = -\curvecurv_i^- \nor_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \tang_i^- = -\curvecurv_{L_i} \nor_{L_i} + \tangspeed_{L_i} \tang_{L_i}
\end{equation}
at each node \(a_i\). Note that we are free to choose any smooth, \(\tangspeed_i, \tangspeed_{L_i}\) functions satisfying \eqref{eq:speedcompatability} without affecting the image of the evolving network in the plane.

Using the triple conditions \eqref{eq:triplecondition} \eqref{eq:triplerelations}, the first equality allows us to write \(v_i^{\pm}\) in terms of the curvatures \(\curvecurv_i^{\pm}\) and vice-versa:
\begin{align*}
\tangspeed_i^+ &= \ip{-\curvecurv_i^- \nor_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \tang_i^-}{\tang_i^+} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \curvecurv_i^- + \frac{1}{2} \tangspeed_i^- \\
\tangspeed_i^- &= \ip{-\curvecurv_i^+ \nor_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \tang_i^+}{\tang_i^-} = - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \curvecurv_i^+ + \frac{1}{2} \tangspeed_i^+.
\end{align*}
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tangspeedcurvture}
\tangspeed_i^+ = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \curvecurv_i^- - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \curvecurv_i^+, \quad \tangspeed_i^- = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \curvecurv_i^+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \curvecurv_i^-
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:curvturetangentialspeed}
\curvecurv_i^+ = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \tangspeed_i^- + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \tangspeed_i^+, \quad \curvecurv_i^- = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \tangspeed_i^+ - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \tangspeed_i^-.
\end{equation}

Finally, let us define the corner tangential speed difference,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cornerspeed}
\corneranglespeed_i = \tangspeed_i^+ - \tangspeed_i^- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(\curvecurv_i^- + \curvecurv_i^+\right).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Basic Evolution Equations}
\label{sec:orgheadline4}

Let us assume that the loop \(\gamma_t\) is parametrised by \((u, t) \in [0, 2\pi] \times [0, T)\). Throughout we denote by \(s\) the arc length parameter so that
\[
\partial_s = \frac{1}{\|\gamma_t'|} \partial_u, \quad ds = \|\gamma_t'\| du
\]
where primes denote differentiation with respect to \(u\).

The evolution of geometric quantities under the Curve Shortening Flow is the same for networks as in the smooth case. This is immediate for any pointwise quantities, and we record the required equations in a lemma for later convenience.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:basic_evolution}
The following evolution equations hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \([\partial_s, \partial_t] = -(\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2) \partial_s\)
\item \(\pd[ds]{t} = (\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2) ds\)
\item \(\pd[\tang]{t} = -(\partial_s \curvecurv + \tangspeed\curvecurv) \nor\)
\item \(\pd[\nor]{t} = (\partial_s \curvecurv + \tangspeed\curvecurv) \tang\)
\item \(\pd[\curvecurv]{t} = \partial_s^2 \curvecurv + \curvecurv^3 + \tangspeed \partial_s \curvecurv\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

Let us now state the definitions we use for intrinsic and extrinsic distances. Note in particular, the intrinsic distance we use is oriented which is for convenience and makes for slightly cleaner exposition later.

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:dist}
Let \((p,q) \in \gamma \times \gamma\). The \emph{extrinsic distance} is defined to be,
\[
d_t(p, q) = \|\gamma_t(q) - \gamma_t(p)\|.
\]
The \emph{oriented intrinsic distance} or \emph{oriented arc length} is defined to be,
\[
\ell_t(p, q) = \int_{\gamma_t} ds_t = \int_p^{a_i} ds_t + \sum_{m=i+1}^{j-1} \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} ds_t + \int_{a_{j-1}}^q ds_t
\]
where \(p \in I_i = [a_{i-1}, a_i]\), \(q \in I_j = [a_{j-1}, a_j]\) and \(i,j\) are taken modulo \(k\).
\end{defn}

Note that by oriented, we mean the length along \(\gamma\) from \(p\) to \(q\) in the chosen orientation of \(\gamma\). For \(p > q\), (for the moment not taking \(i,j\) modulo \(k\)),
\[
\ell(p, q) = \int_p^{a_i} ds_t + \sum_{m=i+1}^{k} \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} ds_t + \sum_{m=1}^{j-1} \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} ds_t + \int_{a_{j-1}}^q ds_t
\]
and \(\ell(p, q)\) is always non-negative. Note also that with our definition \(\ell\) is not symmetric but satisfies,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ell_symmetry}
\ell(q, p) = 2\pi L - \ell(p, q).
\end{equation}
The usual intrinsic distance between \(p\) and \(q\), denoted here by \(\tilde{\ell}(p, q)\), satisfies
\[
\tilde{\ell}(p, q) = \min\{\ell(p, q), \ell(q, p)\} = \min\{\ell(p, q), 2\pi L - \ell(p, q)\}.
\]

Let us also define
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w}
w(p, q) = \frac{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}{d(p,q)},
\end{equation}
the unit vector pointing from \(p\) to \(q\).

Later we will only require the evolution of the extrinsic and intrinsic distances at smooth points.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:distance_evolution}

Let \((p,q) \in \gamma_t^{\ast}\) be smooth points. Then,
\begin{align*}
\partial_t d_t(p, q) &= -\curvecurv_q \ip{\nor_q}{w} + \curvecurv_p \ip{\nor_p}{w} + \tangspeed_q \ip{\tang_q}{w} - \tangspeed_p \ip{\tang_p}{w}, \\
\partial_t \ell_t(p, q) &= - \int_p^q \curvecurv^2 ds + \tangspeed(q) - \tangspeed(p) - \sum_{m=i}^{j-1} \corneranglespeed_m \\
\intertext{and}
\partial_t L &= - \int_{\gamma} \curvecurv^2 ds + \sum_{m=i}^{k} \corneranglespeed_m.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
From the evolution equation \eqref{eq:csf_with_tang} we obtain,
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_t \ip{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)} &= 2 \ip{-\curvecurv(q) \nor(q) + \tangspeed(q) \tang(q)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)} \\
&\quad  - 2 \ip{-\curvecurv(p) \nor(p) + \tangspeed(p) \tang(p)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}.
\end{split}
\]
The evolution of \(d = \left(\ip{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}\right)^{1/2}\) follows by the chain rule and the definition of \(w\).

Using the evolution of \(ds\) from Lemma \ref{lem:basic_evolution},
\begin{align*}
\partial_t \ell(p,q) &= \partial_t \int_p^{a_i} ds_t + \sum_{m=i+1}^{j-1} \partial_t \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} ds_t + \partial_t  \int_{a_{j-1}}^q ds_t \\
&= \int_p^{a_i} (\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2 )ds_t + \sum_{m=i+1}^{j-1} \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} (\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2 )ds_t + \int_{a_{j-1}}^q (\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2) ds_t \\
&= -\int_p^q \curvecurv^2 ds + \tangspeed_i^- - \tangspeed(p) + \sum_{m=i+1}^{j-1} \tangspeed_m^- - \tangspeed_{m-1}^+ + \tangspeed(q) - \tangspeed_{j-1}^+ \\
&= -\int_p^q \curvecurv^2 ds + \tangspeed(q) - \tangspeed(p) + \sum_{m=i}^{j-1} \tangspeed_m^- - \tangspeed_m^+.
\end{align*}
The evolution of \(\ell\) follows immediately from the definition of \(\corneranglespeed\), while the evolution of \(L\) follows by taking \(p=a_0\), \(q=a_k\).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Unlike the smooth case, it is a-priori possible that length actually increases under the network flow. See also the remark below following Lemma \ref{lem:dtA}.
\end{remark}

It's also worth remarking that the evolution of the extrinsic distance does not feel the presence of the nodes, while the intrinsic length, being forced to traverse the nodes does. Next we compute the evolution of enclosed area, which by Stokes' theorem may be computed as an integral along \(\gamma\) and hence also feels the presence of the nodes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:dtA}
The enclosed area evolves by,
\[
\partial_t \area = - \left(2 - \tfrac{k}{3}\right)\pi + \sum_{i=1}^k \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ - \curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^-}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We use the formula,
\[
\area = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_i} \ip{\gamma}{\nor} ds
\]
to compute,
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_t \area &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_i} \ip{\partial_t \gamma}{\nor} ds \\
&\quad + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_i} \ip{\gamma}{\partial_t \nor} ds + \ip{\gamma}{\nor} \partial_t ds
\end{split}
\]

The first term is,
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_i} \ip{\partial_t \gamma}{\nor} ds = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_i} \ip{-\curvecurv \nor + \tangspeed \tang}{\nor} ds = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{\gamma} \curvecurv.
\]

Using the evolution equations in Lemma \ref{lem:basic_evolution} and the Frenet-Serret equations \eqref{eq:frenetserret}, the integrand in the second term is,
\[
\begin{split}
\ip{\gamma}{\partial_t \nor} ds + \ip{\gamma}{\nor} \partial_t ds &= \ip{\gamma}{(\partial_s \curvecurv + \tangspeed \curvecurv)\tang} ds + \ip{\gamma}{\nor} (\partial_s \tangspeed - \curvecurv^2) ds \\
&= \ip{\gamma}{\partial_s(\curvecurv\tang) + \curvecurv^2 \nor} ds + \tangspeed\curvecurv \ip{\gamma}{\tang} ds \\
&\quad + \ip{\gamma}{\partial_s (\tangspeed \nor) - \tangspeed \curvecurv \tang} ds - \curvecurv^2 \ip{\gamma}{\nor} ds \\
&= \partial_s \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv\tang + \tangspeed \nor} ds - \ip{\tang}{\curvecurv \tang + \tangspeed \nor} ds \\
&= \partial_s \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv\tang + \tangspeed \nor} ds - \curvecurv ds.
\end{split}
\]
Integrating we obtain,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dtA_prelim}
\begin{split}
\partial_t \area &= -\int_{\gamma} \curvecurv ds + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \nor_i^+} - \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \nor_i^-} \\
&= - \left(2 - \tfrac{k}{3}\right)\pi + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \nor_i^+} - \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \nor_i^-},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
since the turning angle at each node is \(\theta_i = \arccos \ip{\tang^+}{\tang^-} = \tfrac{\pi}{3}\).

As to the sum, the compatibility conditions,
\[
-\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \nor_i^+ = -\curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \nor_i^- \tag{\ref{eq:speedcompatability} revisited}
\]
give
\[
\ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ + \tangspeed_i^+ \nor_i^+} - \ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^- + \tangspeed_i^- \nor_i^-} = 2\ip{\gamma}{\curvecurv_i^+ \tang_i^+ - \curvecurv_i^- \tang_i^-}.
\]
Substituting into equation \eqref{eq:dtA_prelim} gives the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sum on the right hand side of the evolution of \(\area\) will generally not vanish. In certain symmetric cases, such as the convex, symmetric, lens shaped networks studied in \cite{MR2763716}, the symmetry does in fact cause the terms to cancel. In that situation, there are two nodes \(a_1, a_2\) and \(\curvecurv^{\pm}_1 = \curvecurv^{\mp}_2\). Such symmetries, being invariance under ambient isometry, are of course preserved along the flow. The presence of the nodes is still felt in these cases through \(\partial_t \area = -(2- \tfrac{k}{3})\pi\) (as opposed to \(\partial_t \area = - 2\pi\) in the smooth case) but only the number of nodes \(k\), is relevant.

\item From the term, \(-(2- \tfrac{k}{3})\pi\) in \(\partial_t \area\), we see that increasing the number of nodes tends to slow the contraction. In fact, it is quite possible (especially for \(k > 6\)) that \(\partial_t \area > 0\), whence \(\gamma\) expands. Compare with the smooth curve shortening flow where \(\partial_t \area = - 2\pi < 0\).

\item In the particular case \(k = 6\), there exist static solutions enclosing area \(A\) for every \(A > 0\). These are obtained by letting \(\gamma\) be any equi-angular hexagon, and the \(L_i\) straight lines. On the other hand, by Gauss-Bonnet, and the triple condition we have \(\int_{\gamma} \curvecurv = (2 - \tfrac{k}{3}) \pi\), so that \(\gamma\) is polygonal if and only if \(\curvecurv \equiv 0\), if and only if \(k = 6\) and \(\gamma\) is an equi-angular hexagon. Given such an initial, equi-angular hexagon \(\gamma\), if the \(L_i\) are not straight lines, then the curvature at the node will drive \(\gamma\) away from a hexagon. Even if the curvature of the \(L_i\) vanishes in a neighbourhood of node, but is not identically zero, we expect infinite propagation speed to force the curvature at the node away from zero and again disturb the hexagon. Thus the static solutions are unstable under small perturbations.

\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\section{Short time existence and uniqueness}
\label{sec:orgheadline6}
Clean up \cite{MR1240580} and make it more geometric.
\section{The chord-arc profile}
\label{sec:orgheadline10}

In this section we introduce the chord-arc-profile of a simple closed curve and derive some its properties. The results are particularly appealing for strictly convex curves. The discussion here is similar to \cite{alpha_csf_dist_comp} for flows of smooth curves in the plane. Of course, the presence of nodes for networks is felt here.

\subsection{Definition and basic properties}
\label{sec:orgheadline7}

By using the oriented intrinsic distance, we are able to give a single, clean definition of the chord-arc profile for \(x \in (0, 2\pi)\) rather than just for \(x \in (0, \pi)\) as is the case for the usual, un-oriented intrinsic distance. In brief, the chord-arc profile gives the least length of a chord joining to points for each pair of points of a fixed, oriented arc-length (intrinsic distance) apart.

\begin{defn}
Let \(\gamma\) be a rectifiable, Jordan curve in the plane with total length \(L\) and parametrised by \(\gamma: \sphere^1 \to \RR^2\). For \(x\in (0, 2\pi)\), the \emph{chord-arc profile} of \(\gamma\) is defined as
\[
\chordarcprofile (x) = \frac{2\pi}{L} \inf\left\{d(p, q): (p,q) \in \sphere^1\times\sphere^1, \ell(p,q) = \frac{L}{2\pi} x\right\}
\]
where \(d, \ell\) are the extrinsic and oriented intrinsic distances from Definition \ref{defn:dist} respectively.
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
By compactness of \(\sphere^1\times \sphere^1\) (which parametrises the set of connected arcs of \(\gamma\)) and by continuity of \(\ell\) and \(d\), for any \(x\) the infimum is attained so that there exists \((p_0,q_0) \in \sphere^1 \times \sphere^1\) with \(\ell(p_0, q_0) = \frac{L}{2\pi}x\) and such that \(\chordarcprofile(x) = \frac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0, q_0)\). Also, since \(\ell(p,p) = 0\), for any \(x\in(0,2\pi)\) we have \(p_0 \ne q_0\) and so \(d\) is smooth at \((p_0, q_0)\). Note also that since \(\ell(q_0, p_0) = L - \ell(p_0, q_0)\), we have \(\ell(p_0, q_0) = \tfrac{L}{2\pi}x\) if and only if \(\ell(q_0, p_0) = \frac{L}{2\pi}(2\pi - x)\) and hence \(\chordarcprofile\) is symmetric about \(x = \pi\).
\end{remark}

The next proposition gives the asymptotic behaviour of the chord/arc-profile of networks \(\network\), near the end point \(x=0\), and so by symmetry also at the end point \(x=2\pi\).

\begin{prop}
Let \(\network\) be a network, with piecewise closed curve \(\gamma\). Then as \(x\to 0\) the chord/arc-profile of \(\gamma\) satisfies
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x}{x^2} = - \frac{L}{32\pi} \max_i \{\curvecurv^+(a_i) + \curvecurv^-(a_i)\}
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By taking $x$ small, we consider either points $(p,q) \in \overline{\gamma_i}$ or points $p \in \gamma_i, q \in \gamma_{i+1}$. In the former case, because the curve is straight to first order, $d = \ell + \bigo(\ell^2)$. In the latter case, to first order, the curve is two straight lines meeting at an angle of $2\pi/3$ and so $d = \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ell + \bigo(\ell^2)$. Thus for sufficiently small $x$, the infimum in the definition of $\chordarcprofile$ is attained in the latter case with $p,q$ lying on either side of a node.

Recall that we partition \([0, L]\) into \(0 = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_{k-1} < a_k = L\), writing \(I_i = [a_{i-1}, a_i]\) and \(\gamma_i = \gamma_{I_i}\). In that case, parametrising by arc-length $s$, near each node $a_i$ we have
\[
d^2(a_i - s, a_i + s) = \ip{\gamma_{i+1}(a_i + s) - \gamma_{i-1}(a_i - s)}{\gamma_{i+1}(a_i + s) - \gamma_{i-1}(a_i - s)}.
\]
Then differentiating (and suppressing the arguments \(a_i + s, a_i - s\) for clarity), we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{ds} d^2 &= 2 \ip{\tang_{i+1} + \tang_{i-1}}{\gamma_{i+1} - \gamma_i} \\
\frac{d^2}{ds^2} d^2 &= 2 \ip{-\curvecurv_{i+1} \nor_{i+1} + \curvecurv_{i-1} \nor_{i-1}}{\gamma_{i+1} - \gamma_i} \\
&\quad + 2 \ip{\tang_{i+1} + \tang_{i-1}}{\tang_{i+1} + \tang_{i-1}} \\
\frac{d^3}{ds^3} d^2 &= 2 \ip{\partial_s(-\curvecurv_{i+1} \nor_{i+1}  + \curvecurv_{i-1} \nor_{i-1} )}{\gamma_{i+1}  - \gamma_i} \\
&\quad + 2 \ip{-\curvecurv_{i+1} \nor_{i+1}  + \curvecurv_{i-1} \nor_{i-1} }{\tang_{i+1} + \tang_{i-1}} \\
&\quad + 4 \ip{-\curvecurv_{i+1} \nor_{i+1}  + \curvecurv_{i-1} \nor_{i-1} }{\tang_{i+1} + \tang_{i-1}}
\end{align*}
At \(s = 0\) we then have,
\begin{align*}
\left. d^2 \right|_{s=0} &= 0 \\
\left.\frac{d}{ds} d^2\right|_{s=0} &= 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{d^2}{ds^2} d^2 \right|_{s=0} &= \abs{\tang_i^+ + \tang_i^-}^2 = \abs{\tang_i^+} + \abs{\tang_i^-} + 2\ip{\tang_i^+}{\tang_i-} = 3 \\
\frac{1}{6} \left.\frac{d^3}{ds^3} d^2 \right|_{s=0} &= -\curvecurv_i^+ \ip{\nor_i^+}{\tang_i^-} + \curvecurv_i^- \ip{\nor_i^-}{\tang_i^+} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (\curvecurv_i^+ + \curvecurv_i^-) \\
\end{align*}

Thus, expanding \(d^2(a_i - s, a_i + s)\) in a Taylor-series about \(s = 0\) and taking the square root, we obtain
\[
d(a_i - s, a_i + s) = \sqrt{3} s - \frac{1}{4} (\curvecurv^+_i + \curvecurv^-_i) s^2 + R s^3
\]
with \(R\) bounded independently of \(a_i\) and depending only on bounds for \(\max_i \{\partial^{m}_s \curvecurv_i^{\pm}, 0 \leq m \leq 2\}\). The equation is true for each \(i\) and so certainly holds for \(i\) such that \((\curvecurv^+_i + \curvecurv^-_i)\) is maximised. Denote such an \(i\) by \(i_{\max}\). Thus,
\[
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(a_{i_{\max}} - s, a_{i_{\max}} + s) - \sqrt{3} s}{s^2} = - \frac{1}{4} (\curvecurv^+_{i_{\max}} + \curvecurv^-_{i_{\max}})
\]

If we knew that for small \(x\), the infimum defining \(\chordarcprofile\) was realized symmetrically so that \(\chordarcprofile(x) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(a_i - s, a_i + s)\), then we'd be done. We cannot guarantee this will be happen, but we only need it to first order. That is, choose \(s_1, s_2 > 0\) such that \(\chordarcprofile(x) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(a_i - s_1, a_i + s_2)\) with \(x = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} \ell(a_i - s_1, a_i + s_2) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} (s_1 + s_2)\). Let \(\epsilon = s_2 - s_1 \in (-\tfrac{2\pi}{L} x, \tfrac{2\pi}{L}x)\). Noting that \((a_i - s_1, a_i + s_2)\) is a smooth point, expanding to first order in \(\epsilon\) near \(\epsilon = 0\) we have,
\[
\begin{split}
\abs{\frac{2\pi}{L} d(a_i - s_1, a_i + s_1) - \chordarcprofile(x)} &= \abs{d(a_i - s_1, a_i + s_1) - d(a_i - s_1, a_i + s_1 + \epsilon)} \\
&\leq C\abs{\epsilon} \leq C x.
\end{split}
\]

Then
\[
\begin{split}
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x}{x^2} &= \lim_{s_1\to 0} \frac{\tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(a_{i_{\max}} - s_1, a_{i_{\max}} + s_1) - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \tfrac{2\pi}{L} 2s_1}{\tfrac{4\pi^2}{L^2} 4 s_1^2} \\
&= - \frac{L}{32\pi} \max_i \{\curvecurv^+(a_i) + \curvecurv^-(a_i)\}.
\end{split}
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
For comparison, note that in the smooth case we have,
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - x}{x^3} = - \frac{L^2}{96 \pi^2} \sup_{\gamma} \curvecurv^2.
\]
There is a \emph{qualitative} change in behaviour. Firstly, the first order coefficient is \(1\), reflecting that a smooth curve is equal to it's tangent line to first order, whereas near a node, a network is equal to a cone of opening angle \(2\pi/3\) to first order.  Secondly, the next order term is cubic in the smooth case, and quadratic in the network case. In both cases however, we do see a concentration around maximum curvature, where in the network case, a node has infinite curvature concentrated at a point, like a dirac measure.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Variations}
\label{sec:orgheadline8}

The main techniques we employ in this paper to understand the chord/arc-profile are variational and we begin with the first and second variations of the geometric quantities \(\ell\) and \(d\). Throughout this section we will assume that \(\gamma\) is parametrised by arc-length. As with the evolution of \(\ell\) and \(d\), we generally only require the variations at smooth points, so throughout this section we also assume that \((p,q) \in \gamma^{\ast} \times \gamma^{\ast}\) is a smooth point. The only exception is that we will have occasion later to use the first variation, Lemma \ref{lem:firstvar} at a node and so we state it for arbitrary points \((p,q)\).

Recall that \(w\) defined in equation \eqref{eq:w} denotes the unit vector pointing from \(\gamma(p)\) to \(\gamma(q)\). Let us also write $\omega_p$ and $\omega_q$ for the $1$-forms dual to the unit tangent vectors $\tang_p$ and $\tang_q$ at $p$ and $q$ respectively.

The derivation is quite standard these days, but we give the full details here to be complete. Recall from Definition \ref{defn:dist} that the extrinsic distance is defined to be,
\[
d_t(p, q) = \|\gamma_t(q) - \gamma_t(p)\|.
\]
and the oriented intrinsic distance is defined to be
\[
\ell_t(p, q) = \int_{\gamma_t} ds_t = \int_p^{a_i} ds_t + \sum_{m=i+1}^{j-1} \int_{a_{m-1}}^{a_m} ds_t + \int_{a_{j-1}}^q ds_t.
\]

We need to take a little care at a node, distinguishing between variations in the direction \(\tang^+\) and variations in the direction \(\tang^-\). It's easier to phrase this by varying \(p\) and \(q\) individually and then using linearity. For convenience, let us also write \(\tang^+ = \tang^-\) for the tangent at a smooth point.

\begin{lemma}[First Variation]
\label{lem:firstvar}
\[
\begin{split}
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} \ell (p \pm u, q)  &= \mp 1 \\
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} (p, q \pm u) &= \pm 1.
\end{split}
\]
and
\[
\begin{split}
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} d (p \pm u, q) &= \mp \ip{\tang^{\pm}(p)}{w} \\
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} d (p, q \pm u) &= \pm \ip{\tang^{\pm}(q)}{w}.
\end{split}
\]
In particular, at smooth points \((p,q) \in \gamma^{\ast} \times \gamma^{\ast}\) we have,
\[
D\ell = -\omega_p + \omega_q
\]
and
\[
D d = -\ip{\tang_p}{w} \omega_p + \ip{\tang_q}{w} \omega_q.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The variations of \(l\) follow by taking one-sided derivatives of \(\int_{p\pm u}^{a_i} ds_t\) and \(\int_{a_{j-1}}^{q \pm u} ds_t\) with respect to u.

For \(d\),
\[
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} \ip{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p \pm u)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p \pm u)} = \mp 2 \ip{\tang^{\pm}(p)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}.
\]
Hence,
\[
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} d (p \pm u, q) =  \mp \frac{1}{d} \ip{\tang^{\pm}(p)}{\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)} = \mp \ip{\tang^{\pm}(p)}{w}.
\]
The variation in the second argument is similar.
\end{proof}

As an application of the first variation formula, we have a sufficient condition for optimal points to be smooth. This condition turns out to be quite important (see Lemma \ref{lem:concave_barrier}), effictively allowing us to consider only variations at smooth points.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:optimum_are_regular}

Let \((p_0,q_0) \in \sphere^1 \times \sphere^1\) be optimal; that is \(Z(\tfrac{2\pi}{L}\ell(p_0,q_0)) = \tfrac{L}{2\pi} d(p_0, q_0)\) and suppose that the chord,
\[
\overline{p_0 q_0} = \{v \gamma(p_0) + (1-v) \gamma(q_0) : v \in [0, 1]\} \subseteq \overline{\Omega}
\]
where \(\overline{\Omega}\) denotes the closed region enclosed by \(\gamma\). Then \((p_0, q_0) \in \gamma^{\ast} \times \gamma^{\ast}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

The conclusion, that \((p_0, q_0) \in \gamma^{\ast} \times \gamma^{\ast}\) is the statement that neither \(p_0\) nor \(q_0\) is a node. The proof is symmetric in \(p_0, q_0\) so without loss of generality, let \(p_0 = a_i\) for some \(i\). Given any \(q_0\), a node or otherwise, we will produce a length preserving, strictly distance decreasing variation and hence \((p_0, q_0)\) cannot be optimal for any \(q_0\).

Let \(\alpha_{\pm} (u) = (p_0 \pm u, q_0 \pm u)\). Then \(\ell(\alpha_{\pm} (u)) = \ell(p_0, q_0)\) is constant. Lemma \ref{lem:firstvar} gives
\[
\left.\partial_u\right|_{u=0} d (\alpha_{\pm} (u)) = \pm \left(-\ip{\tang^{\pm}_{p_0}}{w} + \ip{\tang^{\pm}_{q_0}}{w}\right).
\]
If \(-\ip{\tang_{p_0}^+}{w} + \ip{\tang_{q_0}^+}{w} < 0\) then $\alpha_+$ is our desired variation. If not, then,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:optimal_regular_supposition}
-\ip{\tang_{p_0}^+}{w} + \ip{\tang_{q_0}^+}{w} \geq 0.
\end{equation}
Thus we want to show the hypothesis of the Lemma and equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_supposition} imply that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:optimal_regular_desired}
\ip{\tang_{p_0}^-}{w} - \ip{\tang_{q_0}^-}{w} < 0
\end{equation}
in which case, $\alpha_-$ is our desired variation.

In order to show equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_desired} holds, by equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_supposition}, it suffices to show that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:optimal_regular_q}
\ip{\tang_{q_0}^-}{w} &> \ip{\tang_{q_0}^+}{w} \\
\intertext{and}
\label{eq:optimal_regular_p}
\ip{\tang_{p_0}^-}{w} &< \ip{\tang_{p_0}^+ }{w}.
\end{align}

Now we make use of our hypothesis. Since \(\overline{p_0q_0} \subseteq \overline{\Omega}\), we have that at \(p_0\), \(w\) lies in the cone subtended by \(\tang_{p_0}^+\) and \(-\tang_{p_0}^-\) whilst at \(q_0\), \(w\) lies in the cone subtended by \(-\tang_{q_0}^+\) and \(\tang_{q_0}^-\). See figure \ref{fg:optimal_smooth}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{optimal_smooth}
\caption{The chord $\overline{p_0q_0} \subseteq \overline{\Omega}$ so that $w$ lies in the cones subtended by the dotted lines at $p_0$ and $q_0$.}
\label{fig:optimal_smooth}
\end{figure}

For equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_p}, noting that at \(p_0\), \(w\) is inward while \(\nor_{p_0}^+\) is outward, we write
\[
w = \cos \theta_{p_0}^+ \tang_{p_0}^+ - \sin \theta_{p_0}^+ \nor^+_{p_0}.
\]
The condition that \(w\) lies in the cone subtended by \(\tang_{p_0}^+\) and \(-\tang_{p_0}^-\) and the triple condition $\ip{\tang^+}{-\tang^-} = -\tfrac{1}{2} = \arccos\left(\tfrac{2\pi}{3}\right)$ (equation \eqref{eq:triplecondition}) implies that $0 \leq \theta^+_{p_0} \leq \tfrac{2\pi}{3}$. The triple conditions, equations \eqref{eq:triplecondition} and \eqref{eq:triplerelations} also imply that
\[
\tang_{p_0}^- = \frac{1}{2} \tang_{p_0}^+ + \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \nor_{p_0}^+
\]
Then,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:optimal_regular_p_f}
\ip{\tang_{p_0}^- - \tang_{p_0}^+}{w} = - \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos \theta_{p_0}^+ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin \theta_{p_0}^+\right)
\end{equation}

Define,
\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin\theta
\]
Observe that,
\[
f(0) = f \left(\tfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2},
\]
and on $[0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}]$, $f$ is strictly concave. Thus $f > 0$ on $[0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}]$, and hence by equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_p_f},
\[
\ip{\tang_{p_0}^- - \tang_{p_0}^+}{w} = - f (\theta_{p_0}^+) < 0
\]
proving equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_p}.

Equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_q} is similar noting that this time, at \(q_0\) both \(w\) and \(\nor_{q_0}^-\) are  outward pointing. Thus we write
\[
w = \cos \theta_{q_0}^- \tang_{p_0}^- + \sin \theta_{q_0}^- \nor^-_{q_0}
\]
again with $0 \leq \theta^-_{q_0} \leq \tfrac{2\pi}{3}$, and
\[
\tang_{q_0}^+ = \frac{1}{2} \tang_{q_0}^- - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \nor_{q_0}^-.
\]
Hence,
\[
\ip{\tang_{q_0}^- - \tang_{q_0}^+}{w} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos \theta_{q_0}^- + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin \theta_{q_0}^-\right) > 0
\]
proving equation \eqref{eq:optimal_regular_q}.
\end{proof}

As noted above, the Lemma allows us to compute the second variation at smooth points only.

\begin{lemma}[Second Variation]
\label{lem:secondvar}
Let \((p,q)\) be a smooth point. Then,
\[
D^2 \ell = 0
\]
and
\[
\begin{split}
D^2d &= \left(\ip{w}{\curvecurv_p \nor_p} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \ip{w}{\tang_p}^2) \right) \omega_p \tensor \omega_p \\
&+ \left(-\ip{w}{\curvecurv_q \nor_q} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \ip{w}{\tang_q}^2) \right) \omega_q \tensor \omega_q \\
&- \left(\frac{1}{d}\left(\ip{\tang_p}{\tang_q} - \ip{w}{\tang_p}\ip{w}{\tang_q}\right) \right) \left(\omega_p \tensor \omega_q + \omega_q \tensor \omega_p\right).
\end{split}
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The second variation of \(\ell\) is immediate by differentiating the first variation in Lemma \ref{lem:firstvar}.

For the second variation of \(d\), we first differentiate $w$:
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_p w &= \partial_p \left[\frac{1}{d} (\gamma(q) - \gamma(p))\right] \\
&= \frac{1}{d^2} \ip{w}{\tang_p} (\gamma(q) - \gamma(p)) - \frac{1}{d} \tang_p \\
&= -\frac{1}{d}\left(\tang_p - \ip{w}{\tang_p} w\right).
\end{split}
\]
and similarly for $\pd{q} w$ (again with the sign changed).  Putting this together with the Frenet-Serret formula $\pd{p} \tang_p = -\curvecurv_p \nor_p$ \eqref{eq:frenetserret} then gives
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_p^2 d &= \partial_p \left[-\ip{\tang_p}{w}\right] \\
&= \ip{\frac{1}{d}\left(\tang_p - \ip{w}{\tang_p} w\right)}{\tang_p} + \ip{w}{\curvecurv_p \nor_p} \\
&= \frac{1}{d}\left(1 - \ip{w}{\tang_p}^2\right) + \ip{w}{\curvecurv_p \nor_p}.
\end{split}
\]
Similar computations give $\partial_q^2 d$. For the mixed partial,
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_q \partial_p d &= \partial_q \left[-\ip{w}{\tang_p}\right] \\
&= -\ip{\frac{1}{d}(\tang_q - \ip{\tang_q}{w}w}{\tang_p} \\
&= - \frac{1}{d} \left(\ip{\tang_q}{\tang_p} - \ip{\tang_q}{w}\ip{\tang_p}{w}\right).
\end{split}
\]
These second derivatives yield the desired expression for \(D^2 d\).
\end{proof}

Using Lemmas \ref{lem:firstvar} and \ref{lem:secondvar} we may now obtain the second variation formula at smooth, optimal points. Let us first introduce some notation. Write \(\theta(p,q) \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2)\) for the angle between \(\tang_{p}\) and \(w\) so that \(\ip{w}{\tang_p} = \cos\theta\). Define the following "indicator" functions,
\begin{align*}
\tangindicator(p, q) &= \begin{cases}
1,& \tang_{p} \ne \tang_{q} \\
-1,& \tang_{p} = \tang_{q}
\end{cases} \\
\intertext{and}
\norindicator(p, q) &= \begin{cases}
1,& \ip{w}{\nor_{p}} > 0 \\
-1,& \ip{w}{\nor_{p}} < 0.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Define the bilinear forms,
\begin{align*}
K(p, q) &= \norindicator \left(\curvecurv_p \omega_p \otimes \omega_p + \tangindicator \curvecurv_q \omega_q \otimes \omega_q\right), \\
M(p, q) &= \omega_p \otimes \omega_p + \tangindicator\left(\omega_p \otimes \omega_q + \omega_q \otimes \omega_p\right) + \omega_q \otimes \omega_q.
\end{align*}
In matrix form, written with respect to the basis \(\{\tang_p, \tang_q\}\) we have,
\begin{align*}
K(p,q) &= \norindicator\begin{pmatrix}
\curvecurv_{p} & 0 \\
0 & \tangindicator \curvecurv_{q}
\end{pmatrix} \\
M(p,q) &= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \tangindicator \\
\tangindicator & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}

Observe that \(M\) is diagonalised by the eigenvectors
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eigenvectors}
v_1 = \tang_{p} + \tang_{q}, \quad v_2 = \tang_{p} - \tang_{q}
\end{equation}
with corresponding eigenvalues
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eigenvalues}
\lambda_1 (p, q) = \begin{cases}
2, & \tangindicator = 1 \\
0, & \tangindicator = -1
\end{cases}
\quad
\lambda_2 (p, q) = \begin{cases}
0, & \tangindicator = 1 \\
2, & \tangindicator = -1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

We express the variations of distance at an optimal point using this notation.

\begin{prop}[Spatial Variations at Optimal Points]
\label{prop:spatial_var}
Let $(p_0, q_0) \in \sphere^1 \times \sphere^1$ be such that $d(p_0, q_0)$ is minimum amongst all $(p,q)$ such that $\ell(p, q) = \ell(p_0, q_0)$ (or more briefly, $\chordarcprofile\left(\tfrac{L}{2\pi}\ell(p_0,q_0)\right) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0, q_0)$), then
\[
\begin{split}
D d &= \cos\theta(-\omega_{p_0} + \omega_{q_0}) \\
\intertext{and}
D^2d_{(p_0,q_0)} &= \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}K + \frac{1-\cos^2 \theta}{d} M.
\end{split}
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider the curve $\alpha: u \mapsto (p_0,q_0) + uv_1 = (p_0,q_0) + (u, u) \in \sphere^1\times \sphere^1$ which satisfies,
\[
\ell(\alpha(u)) = \ell(\alpha(0)).
\]
Thus $\ell$ is constant, equal to $\ell(p_0, q_0)$ along the curve $\alpha$.

Since $(p_0, q_0)$ minimises $d$ amongst all $(p,q)$ with $\ell(p, q) = \ell(p_0, q_0)$, we have that $u=0$ is a local minima of the function $u\mapsto d(\alpha(u))$. Then from the first variation of $d$ in Lemma \ref{lem:firstvar},
\[
0 = \left.\pd{u}\right|_{u=0} d(\alpha(u)) = -\ip{w}{\tang_{p_0}} + \ip{w}{\tang_{q_0}}
\]
so that
\[
\cos\theta = \ip{\tang_{p_0}}{w} = \ip{\tang_{q_0}}{w}
\]
yielding the desired first variation,
\[
Dd = \cos\theta(-\omega_{p_0} + \omega_{q_0}).
\]

We also have,
\[
\norindicator \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \ip{\nor_p}{w}
\]
recalling that \(\norindicator = \pm 1\) accordingly as \(w\) points outward or inward at \(p\).

Now, either $\tang_{p_0} = \tang_{q_0}$, or $\tang_{p_0} \ne \tang_{q_0}$ and $w$ bisects $\tang_{p_0}$ and $\tang_{q_0}$. These cases are recorded by the indicator function $\tangindicator$.

\emph{Case 1}: $\tang_{p_0} \ne \tang_{q_0}$ ($\tangindicator = 1$).

Assuming that $\tang_{p_0} \ne \tang_{q_0}$, since \(w\) bisects \(\tang_{p_0}\) and \(\tang_{q_0}\), we have
\[
-\ip{w}{\nor_{q_0}} = \ip{w}{\nor_{p_0}} = \norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}.
\]
Also since $w$ bisects $\tang_{p_0}$ and $\tang_{q_0}$, applying the double angle formula yields,
\[
\ip{\tang_{p_0}}{\tang_{q_0}} = 2\cos^2\theta - 1.
\]
Substituting these expressions into the second variation of $d$ from Lemma \ref{lem:secondvar} gives
\begin{align*}
D^2d_{(p_0,q_0)} &=  \left(\norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}\curvecurv_{p_0} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \omega_{p_0} \tensor \omega_{p_0} \\
&+ \left(\norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta} \curvecurv_{q_0} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \omega_{q_0} \tensor \omega_{q_0} \\
&+ \left(\frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \left(\omega_{p_0} \tensor \omega_{q_0} + \omega_{q_0} \tensor \omega_{p_0} \right)
\end{align*}
which is the desired expression when $\tangindicator=1$.

\emph{Case 2}: $\tang_{p_0} = \tang_{q_0}$ ($\tangindicator = 1$).

In this case, we have 
\[
\ip{w}{\nor_{p_0}} = \ip{w}{\nor_{q_0}} = \norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}
\]
and $\ip{\tang_{p_0}}{\tang_{q_0}} = 1$. Substituting these expressions into the second variation of $d$  from Lemma \ref{lem:secondvar} gives
\begin{align*}
D^2d_{(p_0,q_0)} &=  \left(\norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}\curvecurv_{p_0} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \omega_{p_0} \tensor \omega_{p_0} \\
&+ \left(-\norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta} \curvecurv_{q_0} + \frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \omega_{q_0} \tensor \omega_{q_0} \\
&- \left(\frac{1}{d}(1 - \cos^2\theta) \right) \left(\omega_{p_0} \tensor \omega_{q_0} + \omega_{q_0} \tensor \omega_{p_0} \right)
\end{align*}
which gives the desired expression for $\tangindicator=1$ when expressed in matrix form.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Differential inequalities}
\label{sec:orgheadline9}

In this section, using the variational formulae, we obtain two (weak) differential inequalities for \(\chordarcprofile\). The first, Theorem \ref{thm:barrier} is a barrier inequality, asserting the existence of a smooth, upper barrier at \emph{regular} points \(x_0\) (defined below). Such a barrier proves quite useful for deducing properties of the chord-arc profile in the sequel. As a corollary of the barrier inequality, we obtain the second differential inequality, Theorem \ref{thm:spatial_viscosity}. This is a viscosity equation for the chord-arc profile, asserting that \emph{if} a smooth, lower support function exists, it satisfies a certain differential inequality. Such an equation is useful for comparisons and forms the heart of our later arguments.

Let us make the following definition.
\begin{defn}
The point \(x_0 \in (0, 2\pi)\) will be called a \emph{regular point} if there exists a smooth minimiser \((p_0, q_0)\). That is, if there exists \((p_0, q_0) \in \gamma^{\ast} \times \gamma^{\ast}\) such that \(\ell(p_0, q_0) = \tfrac{L}{2\pi} x_0\) and \(\chordarcprofile(x_0) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0, q_0)\).
\end{defn}

Our barrier inequality now reads as follows:

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:barrier}
At regular points \(x_0\), the chord/arc-profile $\chordarcprofile$ satisfies the following differential inequality in the support (or barrier, or sometimes Calabi) sense
\begin{align*}
\chordarcprofile'_- &\leq \cos\theta \leq \chordarcprofile'_+, \\
\chordarcprofile'' &\leq \frac{L}{2\pi}\left[\frac{\norindicator \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}}{4} (\curvecurv_p + \tangindicator\curvecurv_q) + \frac{1}{2}(1-\tangindicator) \frac{1-\cos^2\theta}{d}\right].
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

Recall that the support inequality means for every \(x_0 \in [0,2\pi]\) there exists a smooth, upper support function \(Z\) (\(Z(x) \geq \chordarcprofile (x)\), \(Z(x_0) = \chordarcprofile(x_0)\)) defined in a neighbourhood of \(x_0\) such that
\begin{align*}
Z' &= \cos \theta, \\
Z'' &= \frac{L}{2\pi}\left[\frac{\norindicator\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}}{4} (\curvecurv_p + \tangindicator\curvecurv_q) + \frac{1}{2} (1-\tangindicator) \frac{1-\cos^2\theta}{d}\right].
\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
For any $x_0$, let $(p_0,q_0)$ be such that $\ell(p_0,q_0) = \tfrac{L}{2\pi} x_0$ and $\chordarcprofile(x_0) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0,q_0)$. Consider the curve
\[
\alpha(u) = (p_0, q_0) + uv_2 = (p_0, q_0) + u(1,-1).
\]
Let \(x(u) = \tfrac{2\pi}{L} \ell(\alpha(u))\). We have
\[
\partial_u (\ell \circ \alpha) = -2
\]
so that $\ell\circ\alpha$ has a smooth local inverse near $u=0$: \(u = u(x) = (\ell \circ \alpha)^{-1}(\tfrac{L}{2\pi} x)\) satisfying \(u(x_0) = 0\) and \(u'(x) = -\tfrac{L}{4\pi}\).

Define
\[
Z(x) = \frac{2\pi}{L} d(\alpha \circ u (x))
\]
which is indeed a smooth, upper support function, since
\begin{align*}
Z(x_0) &= \frac{2\pi}{L} d(\alpha(0)) = \frac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0, q_0) = \chordarcprofile(x_0) \\
\intertext{and}
Z(x) &= \frac{2\pi}{L} d(\alpha \circ u(x)) \geq \chordarcprofile \left(\frac{2\pi}{L}\ell\circ\alpha(u(x))\right) = \chordarcprofile(x).
\end{align*}

Observe that $\alpha' = v_2 = \tang_{p_0} - \tang_{q_0}$ so that \(\partial_x \alpha(u(x)) = -\tfrac{L}{4\pi} v_2\). Using also the first variation of $d$ at optimal points in Proposition \ref{prop:spatial_var}
\[
Z'(x_0) = \frac{2\pi}{L} Dd \cdot \left(-\frac{L}{4\pi}v_2\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \cos\theta (-\omega_{p_0} + \omega_{q_0}) \cdot (\tang_{p_0} - \tang_{q_0}) = \cos\theta
\]
proving the first equation.

For the second equation, we have
\[
Z''(x_0) = \frac{2\pi}{L} D^2 d \left(-\frac{L}{4\pi} v_2, -\frac{L}{4\pi} v_2\right) = \frac{L}{8\pi} D^2 d (v_2, v_2)
\]
as a bilinear form. Now apply Proposition \ref{prop:spatial_var} to obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:barrier_secondvar}
Z''(x_0) = \frac{L}{8\pi} \left(\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta} K (v_2, v_2) + \frac{1-\cos^2\theta}{d} M (v_2, v_2)\right).
\end{equation}

We have,
\[
K(v_2, v_2) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\curvecurv_{p} & 0 \\
0 & \tangindicator \curvecurv_{q}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
= \curvecurv_p + \tangindicator \curvecurv_q
\]
and
\[
M(v_2, v_2) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \tangindicator \\
\tangindicator & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{cases}
0, & \tangindicator = 1 \\
4, & \tangindicator = -1.
\end{cases}
\]

Substitution in equation \eqref{eq:barrier_secondvar} gives the desired expression.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In the case \(\tangindicator = 1\), the second term of \(\chordarcprofile''\) is not present. This is because \(v_2\) is an eigenvector of \(M\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in the case \(\tangindicator = 1\). In the case \(\tangindicator = -1\), the corresponding eigenvalue is \(\lambda_2 = 2\) and so the second term is not annihilated. We might like to try annihilate this term by using \(v_1\) instead of \(v_2\) in the case \(\tangindicator = -1\), but this leads to the vacuous equation \(0 = 0\) since the corresponding curve \(\alpha(u) = (p_0, q_0) + u v_1\) preserves length.
\end{remark}

We finish this section with the viscosity equation.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:spatial_viscosity}
At a regular point \(x_0\), the chord-arc profile $\chordarcprofile$ of \(\gamma\) satisfies the following inequality in the viscosity-sense:
\[
-\frac{\chordarcprofile''}{\sqrt{1-(\chordarcprofile')^2}} + \frac{1}{2} (1-\tangindicator) \frac{\sqrt{1 - (\chordarcprofile')^2}}{\chordarcprofile} \geq \frac{L}{8\pi} \norindicator \left[\curvecurv_p + \tangindicator \curvecurv_q\right].
\]
\end{theorem}

This means that for any regular point \(x_0 \in (0,2\pi)\), if \(\varphi\) is a local, smooth, lower supporting function at \(x_0\), (\(\varphi\) is defined in a neighbourhood of \(x_0\) and \(\varphi(x) \leq \chordarcprofile (x)\), \(\varphi(x_0) = \chordarcprofile (x_0)\)), then \(\varphi\) satisfies the inequality in the usual sense. The coefficients, \(\tangindicator, \norindicator, \curvecurv_p, \curvecurv_q\) are evaluated at an optimal point \((p_0, q_0)\) for \(x_0\) and though determined, are a priori unknown.

\begin{proof}
Fix a regular point, $x_0 \in (0,2\pi)$ and suppose $\varphi(x)$ is a smooth function defined in neighbourhood of $x_0$ such that $\varphi(x_0) = \chordarcprofile(x_0)$ and $\varphi(x) \leq \chordarcprofile(x)$. Let \(Z\) denote the smooth, upper barrier function constructed in Theorem \ref{thm:barrier} at \(x_0\). Then,
\[
Z(x) - \varphi(x) \geq \chordarcprofile(x) - \varphi(x) \geq 0, \quad Z(x_0) - \varphi(x_0) = \chordarcprofile(x_0) - \chordarcprofile(x_0) = 0.
\]
Thus the smooth function \(Z(x) - \varphi(x)\) has a local minimum at \(x_0\), hence
\[
Z'(x_0) = \varphi'(x_0), \quad Z''(x_0) \geq \varphi''(x_0).
\]
We also have,
\[
\varphi(x_0) = \chordarcprofile(x_0) = \frac{2\pi}{L} d(p_0, q_0)
\]
where \((p_0, q_0)\) is optimal for \(x_0\).

Recall, Theorem \ref{thm:barrier} implies
\begin{align*}
Z'(x_0) &= \cos \theta, \\
Z''(x_0) &= \frac{L}{2\pi}\left[\frac{\norindicator\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}}{4} (\curvecurv_p + \tangindicator\curvecurv_q) + \frac{1}{2} (1-\tangindicator) \frac{1-\cos^2\theta}{d}\right].
\end{align*}

Thus \(\varphi' = \cos \theta\) and,
\[
\varphi'' \leq \frac{L}{2\pi}\left[\frac{\norindicator\sqrt{1-(\varphi')^2}}{4} (\curvecurv_p + \tangindicator\curvecurv_q) + \frac{1}{2} (1-\tangindicator) \frac{1-(\varphi')^2}{\tfrac{L}{2\pi} \varphi}\right].
\]
Rearranging gives the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Convex Networks}

We now consider the implications of the variational formulae and differential inequalities in the case of convex networks. These are rather more well behaved than general networks, and serve as a model case. In particular, the chord-arc profile is concave. We also deduce some properties for general networks at optimal points that behave similar to the convex case, in particular relating local concavity of the profile to convex-like behaviour at corresponding optimal points. The analysis, particularly of the second variation affords control of the topology of optimal points (through the indicator functions) essential to the comparison arguments later.

First let us remark that convex networks are constrained in the maximum number of nodes possible. In the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:dtA}, we used,
\[
\int \curvecurv ds = (2 - \frac{k}{3}) \pi.
\]
From this equation we may also conclude that if \(\gamma\) is a convex network (so that \(\curvecurv \geq 0\)) with \(k\) nodes satisfying the triple condition \eqref{eq:triplecondition}, then \(k \leq 6\). In the case \(k = 6\), we must have \(\curvecurv \equiv 0\) so that \(\gamma\) is an equi-angular hexagon, and either this condition must be preserved by the network curve shortening flow, or convexity must be lost. What happens is determined by the unbounded curves \(L_i\). In particular, if all the \(L_i\) are straight lines, then such a network is a static solution. Otherwise, we expect the curvature of the \(L_i\) to drive the loop away from convexity. Notice that to keep the loop static, the unbounded curves would need to satisfy the curve shortening flow along with fixed boundary conditions (as the node is stationary) and fixed gradient at the boundary (as the angle must be preserved). This is an over-determined system so we do not expect the loop to be static if at least one of the \(L_i\) is not a straight line.

\begin{lemma}
If $\gamma$ is convex, then $\chordarcprofile$ is concave and if $\gamma$ is strictly convex, then $\chordarcprofile$ is strictly concave.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $\gamma$ is convex, then $\curvecurv \geq 0$ and $\tang_{p_0} \ne \tang_{q_0}$ so that $\xi = 1$. Moreover, since the closure of the region bounded by $\curvecurv$ is a convex body, and since $X(p_0), X(q_0)$ lie in the closure of this region, for any $u \in [0,1]$, we must have that $X(p_0) + u(X(q_0) - X(p_0))$ also lies in this region so that $(X(q_0) - X(p_0))$ (and hence $w = \tfrac{1}{d(p_0,q_0)} (X(q_0) - X(p_0))$) points inward ensuring that $\delta = 1$. Therefore, at every regular point $x_0$, the function $Z$ satisfies
\[
Z'' \leq - \frac{\sqrt{1-\cos^2 \theta}}{4} (\curvecurv_{p_0} + \curvecurv_{q_0}) \leq 0.
\]
Thus $\chordarcprofile$ is supported above by a concave function at all regular points and by Lemma \ref{lem:convex_optimum_regular_points}, there can be at most finitely many non-regular points. Hence $\chordarcprofile$ is itself concave \cite[Lemma 2.7]{MR1674097}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Compare the above with similar results obtained in \cite{MR1674097}, pertaining to isoperimetric regions of convex bodies in Euclidean space and in \cite{MR875084}, pertaining to isoperimetric regions in compact surfaces. As described in \cite{pbthesis}, both arguments lead to the concavity of $\isoprofile^2(x) + K_0 x^2$ where $\isoprofile$ is the isoperimetric profile, and $K_0$ is a lower bound on boundary mean curvature or ambient Gauss curvature respectively. In particular, if the curvature is non-negative, then not only is the isoperimetric profile concave, but it's square also. Here, the analogous result is not true for the chord/arc-profile in the strongest possible sense as seen by the simple counter-example of the unit circle, whose chord/arc-profile is
\[
\chordarcprofile_{\sphere^1} (x) = 2 \sin \left(\frac{x}{2}\right).
\]
This is a strictly concave function whose square is not concave. This seems related to the fact that the local behaviour of the chord/arc-profile is determined by the \emph{square} of the curvature, $\curvecurv^2$ as opposed to the isoperimetric profile of a surface or convex body in the plane, which is locally determined by the curvature (Gauss curvature for compact surfaces and boundary mean curvature for convex bodies in Euclidean space).
\end{remark}

The next lemma gives a useful first application of the first variation formula for \(d\) that allows us to exploit concavity properties of the chord/arc-profile. In particular, it shows that if the chord-arc profile is supported from below by a concave function, then the corresponding optimal points are convex-like.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:concave_barrier}
If there exists a strictly concave, positive function $\phi: (0, 2\pi) \to \RR$ that is symmetric about $\pi$ and supporting $\chordarcprofile$ at $x_0=\ell(p_0,q_0)$ (so that $\phi(x) \leq \chordarcprofile(x)$ and $\phi(x_0)=\chordarcprofile(x_0)$), then $\tang_{p_0} \ne \tang_{q_0}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose there is a $\phi$ as in the statement of the lemma. We proceed as described in \cite{MR2794630}. To obtain a contradiction, let us suppose that $\tang_{p_0} = \tang_{q_0} \ne w$. Then the normal makes an acute angle with the chord $\overline{p_0 q_0}$ at one endpoint, and an obtuse angle at the other. Therefore points on the chord near one endpoint are inside the region enclosed by $\gamma$, while points near the other endpoint are outside, implying that there is at least one other point where the curve $\gamma$ meets the chord. We may assume that an intersection occurs at $s$ with $p_0 < s < q_0$. Then we have
\begin{align*}
d(p_0, q_0) &= d(p_0, s) + d(s, q_0) \\
\ell(p_0, q_0) &= \min\{\ell(p_0, s) + \ell(s, q_0),  2\pi -\ell(p_0,s ) - \ell(s, q_0)\}.
\end{align*}
Since $\phi$ is strictly concave, $\phi(x + y) = \phi(x + y) + \phi(0) \leq \phi(x) + \phi(y)$ whenever $x, y > 0$ and $x + y < 2\pi$. Noting also that $\phi(x) = \phi(2\pi - x)$, we have
\[
\begin{split}
0 = \chordarcprofile(\ell(p_0, q_0)) - \phi(\ell(p_0, q_0)) &=  d(p_0, q_0) - \phi(\ell(p_0, q_0)) \\
&= d(p_0, s) + d(s, q_0) - \phi(\ell(p_0, s) + \ell(s,  q_0)) \\
&> d(p_0, s) - \phi(\ell(p_0, s)) + d(s, q_0) - \phi(\ell(s, q_0)) \\
&\geq \chordarcprofile(\ell(p_0, s)) - \phi(\ell(p_0, s)) + \chordarcprofile(\ell(s, q_0)) - \phi(\ell(s, q_0)) \\
&\geq 0.
\end{split}
\]
Thus we have a contradiction.
\end{proof}
